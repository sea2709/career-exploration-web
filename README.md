# Career Explorer (web)

Astro frontend for the careers-exploration project. The homepage (`/`) is a static introduction to the three tools and the O\*NET data behind them. Each tool is backed by a Gemini-powered agent that uses O\*NET 31.0 data stored in Sanity:

- `/explore`: **Career Explorer**, a chat where visitors ask about careers.
- `/interview`: **Mock Interview Coach**, which interviews the visitor for a chosen occupation and scores each answer against O\*NET skill levels. `?job=<title>` prefills the target job.
- `/quiz`: **Interest Quiz**, where visitors rate work activities and get a RIASEC interest profile with matching occupations.

The browser never talks to the agent directly. Requests go through this app's server routes, which enforce a Cloudflare Turnstile human check and attach the agent's bearer token server-side.

```
Browser (CareerChat / InterviewCoach / InterestQuiz)
  ├─ POST /api/verify-human  { token }  → Cloudflare siteverify → sets human_session cookie
  ├─ POST /api/chat          → AGENT_URL/chat
  ├─ POST /api/interview     → AGENT_URL/interview
  ├─ POST /api/quiz          → AGENT_URL/quiz
  │     (all require a valid human_session cookie, add Authorization: Bearer AGENT_API_TOKEN,
  │      and stream the agent's AI SDK UI message stream back)
  ├─ POST /api/coaching-search { query } → AGENT_URL/coaching-search
  │     (same session check and token; JSON results from the coaching Knowledge Base)
  └─ GET  /api/coaching-guides → Sanity CDN (published coachingGuide documents, no agent call)
```

## Stack

- [Astro 7](https://docs.astro.build) with on-demand rendering for the API routes
- React 19 islands (`client:only="react"`)
- [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`) for the chat stream and tool-call parts
- Tailwind CSS 4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- `react-markdown` for rendering assistant replies
- [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) for bot protection
- `@sanity/astro` integration, with generated schema types in `sanity.types.ts`
- Adapters: `@astrojs/node` (standalone) locally, `@astrojs/vercel` when `VERCEL` is set

## Getting started

Requires Node `>=22.12.0`.

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` from the example and fill it in:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the agent service in `../agent` (it listens on `http://localhost:8787` by default):

   ```sh
   cd ../agent && pnpm dev
   ```

4. Start the web dev server (defaults to `http://localhost:4321`):

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Environment variables

Env vars are declared with `envField` in `astro.config.mjs` and read through `astro:env/server` and `astro:env/client`.

| Variable                    | Context         | Required | Default                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `AGENT_URL`                 | server          | no       | `http://localhost:8787` |
| `AGENT_API_TOKEN`           | server (secret) | yes      | none                    |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`      | server (secret) | yes      | none                    |
| `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | client          | yes      | none                    |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`  | client          | no       | `rhq335ze`              |
| `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`     | client          | no       | `production`            |

Notes:

- `AGENT_API_TOKEN` must match `AGENT_API_TOKEN` in `agent/.env`.
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` also signs the `human_session` cookie, so rotating it invalidates every active session.
- For local development you can use Cloudflare's [always-pass test keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/testing/) (listed in `.env.example`). Never deploy them, because they accept every request.
- The agent only allows CORS from its `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (default `http://localhost:4321`). That doesn't matter for the server-side proxy, but keep it in mind if you change ports.

## How the human check works

1. `HumanCheck` renders an invisible-unless-needed Turnstile widget (`appearance: 'interaction-only'`, `action: 'chat'`).
2. On success it posts the token to `/api/verify-human`, which validates it with Cloudflare's siteverify endpoint.
3. The server sets an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie named `human_session`, scoped to `/api` and valid for 2 hours. The value is `<expiresAt>.<HMAC-SHA256 signature>`.
4. `/api/chat`, `/api/interview`, `/api/quiz`, and `/api/coaching-search` reject requests without a valid session with `403`.
5. `useVerifiedChat` keeps input disabled until verified, re-runs the check 60 seconds before the session expires, and re-runs it on any `403`.

## How the interview coach works

1. The setup form collects the target job, number of questions (3, 5, or 7), and style (mixed, behavioral, or skills). It's sent as the first user message, with the setup attached as message metadata so the UI shows it in the header instead of as a chat bubble.
2. The agent finds the occupation, loads its O\*NET interview brief, and asks one question per turn.
3. After each answer it calls `scoreAnswer`. `InterviewCoach` renders that tool part as a feedback card: a 1–5 rating, the demonstrated level compared with the job's required level on O\*NET's 0–7 scale, the closest O\*NET example, and tips.
4. After the last question (or **End early**) it calls `finishInterview`, rendered as a report card.
5. Progress in the header is derived from the number of `scoreAnswer` results in the conversation.

## How the interest quiz works

1. The setup form asks how much preparation the visitor is open to (a maximum Job Zone, or any). It's sent as the first user message with the setup as metadata.
2. The agent calls `getQuizActivities`, then `presentActivities`. `presentActivities` is a client-side tool: `InterestQuiz` renders it as a rating card using the activities from the matching `getQuizActivities` output, and **Submit ratings** calls `addToolOutput` with `{ ratings }`.
3. `useVerifiedChat` is given `sendAutomaticallyWhen: lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls`, so adding the output sends the next request automatically. The agent runs a second, focused round the same way.
4. The agent then calls `buildInterestProfile` (rendered as a profile card with the Holland code and a 1–7 bar per RIASEC type) and `matchOccupations` (rendered as a match list). Each match links to O\*NET and to `/interview?job=<title>`.
5. After the results, a text input opens for follow-up questions, for example to show jobs that need less training.

## Commands

| Command            | Action                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`         | Start the dev server at `localhost:4321`        |
| `pnpm build`       | Build for production to `./dist/`               |
| `pnpm preview`     | Preview the production build locally            |
| `pnpm astro check` | Type-check `.astro`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files    |

## Regenerating Sanity types

`sanity.types.ts` is written by the studio's TypeGen config (`studio/sanity.cli.ts`). After changing schemas, run this from `../studio`:

```sh
pnpm typegen
```

## Deployment

The adapter is chosen at build time: when the `VERCEL` env var is present (as it is on Vercel builds), `@astrojs/vercel` is used; otherwise the app builds as a standalone Node server with `@astrojs/node`. Set `AGENT_URL`, `AGENT_API_TOKEN`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, and `PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in the hosting environment, and register the production domain on the Turnstile widget.
